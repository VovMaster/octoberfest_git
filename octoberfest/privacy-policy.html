				<h2>KICKS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
				<p>Kicks Entertainment (Event Organiser) works within Moshtix (TGG) privacy policy</p>
				<p><b>Use of Information</b><br>
				When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it.</p>
				<p>We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Your contact details may be used to contact you to inform you of important information related to an event you have purchased tickets to, for example time or event changes or event cancellation. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication.</p>
				<p>If at the time of purchase you agreed to receive information and offers about future events directly from the venue operator and/or promoter(s) of the event by the ticketing platform, then they will provide your contact details to Kicks Entertainment for this purpose. Kicks Entertainment may use these details to contact you with information and offers regarding future events and promotions or similar business. If you wish to change this choice you can contact us but it may be necessary to contact the Moshtix (TGG) directly if your contact details have already been provided. Kicks Entertainment will use your personal information in accordance with Moshtix (TGG)’s privacy policies. If wish to unsubscribe from this communication you should contact Kicks Entertainment directly.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Use of Aggregate Data</b><br>
					We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our goods and services including our Web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites.
				</p>
				<p>Kicks Entertainment may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services including our Web sites and make them more responsive to the needs of our customers.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Security</b><br>
					Kicks in conjunction with Moshtix (TGG) strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information of our customers. We use a variety of physical and electronic security measures including restricting physical access to our offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or unauthorised use or disclosure.
				</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cookies</b><br>
					Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature.

					<b>Access to Personal Information</b><br>
					You have a right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we deny access in some circumstances we will tell you why. To request access, please contact our privacy officer as set out at the end of this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What else you should know about privacy on the Internet</b><br>
					Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.
				</p>
				<p>Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information.
